                <!-- Description of elephants -->
                Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their long trunk, large ears, and tusks. They
                are highly intelligent and social creatures that inhabit diverse habitats across Africa and Asia.

                <!-- Additional description -->
                Elephants play a crucial role in shaping their ecosystems by creating pathways, digging water holes, and
                dispersing seeds. Despite their size, they are capable of remarkable sensitivity and empathy, displaying
                strong emotional bonds within their family groups.

                    <!-- Description of social structure -->
                    Elephants have a complex social structure centered around matriarchal family groups led by the
                    oldest and most experienced female. These groups typically consist of related females and their
                    offspring, with adult males living solitary lives or forming smaller bachelor herds.

                    <!-- Description of trunk -->
                    One of the most distinctive features of elephants is their trunk, which is a fusion of the nose and
                    upper lip. The trunk is a highly versatile appendage used for breathing, grasping objects,
                    manipulating food, and producing sounds for communication.

                    <!-- Description of diet -->
                    Elephants are herbivores with a diet primarily consisting of grasses, leaves, bark, and fruits. They
                    can consume large quantities of food in a single day, often spending up to 16 hours foraging to meet
                    their nutritional needs.

                    <!-- Description of agility -->
                    Despite their size, elephants are surprisingly agile and capable of running at speeds of up to 25
                    miles per hour. They are also excellent swimmers and can use their trunk as a snorkel while
                    submerged underwater.
