                Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their long necks and distinctive coat
                patterns. They inhabit the savannas and grasslands of Africa, where they feed on leaves from tall trees.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2 text-2xl">
                With their long necks, giraffes can reach leaves and branches that other animals cannot, giving them
                access to a unique food source. They have large hearts and specialized blood vessels to help regulate
                blood flow and prevent fainting when they bend down to drink water.

                    Giraffes are social animals that live in loose groups known as towers. These groups typically
                    consist of females and their offspring, while males may form smaller bachelor groups. They
                    communicate through various vocalizations and body language.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-1 text-xl">
                    Despite their large size, giraffes are graceful and agile creatures. They can reach speeds of up to
                    35 miles per hour when running and use their powerful legs and long necks to defend themselves
                    against predators like lions.

                    Giraffes have a unique pattern of spots on their coats, which helps them camouflage and blend in
                    with their surroundings. Each giraffe has a distinct pattern, similar to a human fingerprint.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-1 text-xl">
                    Unfortunately, giraffe populations are declining due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife
                    conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these iconic animals and ensure their
                    survival for future generations.
