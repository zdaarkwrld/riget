                Pandas are beloved around the world for their distinctive black and white markings and playful behavior. They are native to China and are considered a national treasure in the country.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2 text-2xl">
                Despite their bear-like appearance, pandas are classified as carnivores, but their diet consists almost exclusively of bamboo. They have a specialized digestive system to help them process this tough plant material.

                    Pandas spend most of their time eating bamboo, consuming up to 30 pounds of it per day. They have a unique "thumb" on their paws that helps them grip bamboo stalks and strip off the leaves.

                    Despite being solitary animals, pandas are not territorial and may overlap in their home ranges. They communicate through vocalizations, scent marking, and body language.

                    Pandas are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect pandas and their bamboo forests.
